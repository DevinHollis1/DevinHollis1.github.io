                        Hello! My name is Devin Hollis, Iâ€™m 22 years old and this is me. I have 5 brothers and one sister. I grew up in a small town just outside of Detroit, Mi. I enjoy art, music, videography, and anything related to tech! All of that creativity and imagination I put into my hobbies and skills has never stopped and is still with me in whatever I do.

                <h3>Making Music</h3>
            <p>
                I have been making music for as long as I can remember. This skill involves a deep understanding of musical elements and the ability to weave them together seamlessly. It requires a sharp ear for capturing intricate nuances and utilizing digital tools. I have over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lilrichy5080" target="_blank"> 100 combined beats, melodies, and songs</a> that I worked on or did myself! Whether it's composing original pieces or arranging existing music, the skill of making music empowers me to be creative and brings joy to me and my listeners.

        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>
            Ever since I was a child, drawing has been one of my favorite ways past time. From the moment I could hold a pencil, I found joy in what I could create on paper. Drawing allowed me to express my imagination and bring my thoughts to life. Having this skill has allowed me to have a broad imagination and stay creative in whatever I'm doing!

        <h3>Videography</h3>
        <p>
            From an early age, I was captivated by the world of videography. Holding a camera in my hands felt like holding a portal through which I could explore and capture the world around me. As I grew older, my passion for videography only intensified. It became my medium for storytelling, allowing me to weave narratives, evoke emotions, and share meaningful experiences with others. Whether it was capturing the beauty of nature, documenting memorable moments, or experimenting with visual effects, videography has been one of my lifelong passions,  having this skill has shaped my perspective of th e world around me.

        <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
        <p>
            HTML: Having the skill of knowing HTML opens up a world of possibilities in the  digital world.    
                With HTML, I can create and design websites, bringing my ideas or yours to life on the internet. 
                Having this skill enables me to structure and organize content, adding interactivity and visual appeal, while making it accessible and user-friendly. 
                HTML is a fundamental skill that shapes the online experience.<P>
                    CSS: Having the skill of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) helps me design and style web pages. With CSS, I can control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a website. It allows me to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, making any website accessible and user-friendly on various devices.</P>
